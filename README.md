# 52 Card Golf
![52 Card Opening Screen](wireframes/screen-shot-of-intro.jpg)
# Goal for this Project
This project will be a text-based python game where the user has to beat the computer using a little skill but an extraordinary amount of pure luck!! For the user to win the game, they must tactfully swap their cards to create a cumulative score that is lower than the computer.

# UX

## User Goals
* Selection of cards able to be played with
* Continual score feedback throughout the game
* Know when it is the users go and not
* Clear instruction as to how to play the game
* Know the outcome of the game, win, lose or draw

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to personalise my game
* As a user, I want to select a game type
* As a user, I want to be clearly navigated through the game
* As a user, I want to skip through game instructions if required
* As a user, I want to have continual feedback on my score
* As a user, I want to know the outcome of the game

## Site owners Goals
* Where there is lots of text, present it clearly
* Give the user feedback on performance
* Ensure that there is validation for expected answers on all user inputs
* Create a gently flow of text so the user is able to keep up with reading it

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements
* Single page layout
* Feedback on performance
* Clear instruction as to when the game starts and finishes
* Validation of user inputs
* Feedback to the user on their input to the game

### Expectations

## How to Play

* A standard 52 pack of cards is used
    * Ace is 1
    * Jack is 11
    * Queen is 12
    * King is 13
* The user will decide how many cards to be delt (4, 6 or 8)
    * 4 cards selected will play 3 rounds
    * 6 cards selected will play 5 rounds
    * 8 cards selected will play 7 rounds
* The computer will randomly deal then turn the top card of the deck and display it
* The user can elect to swap it for one of their own cards or pass
* After the rounds are completed the game ends
* The winner will have the lowest cumulative score

## Design Choices

### Structure
The structure of this project has been mapped out using [Lucid](https://lucid.co/ "Lucid"). Using the preformed shapes in [Lucid](https://lucid.co/ "Lucid"), I created my key of shapes.

This then allowed me to walk through the project in my head and work out the links between different parts of the game and then changes depending on user input. I began by working out the flow of the beginning of the game, where the user enters the username and makes a decision on reading the rules, this then dictates their pathway to playing the game.

Once this was completed, I could focus on the game itself. I broke it down into every step I imagined that would be taken to navigate through the game.

# Wireframes

The game will be built using a pre-built template that Code Institute has provided. This template already scales down for different screen sizes so I have only produced a desktop wireframe that simply centres the content.
